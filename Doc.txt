Currently breaking up script in order to manage better.

Created a config.php file that will allow the developer to change what they want in the script so that it
works for their site.

Attempting to change the URL method so that it is an Encrypted url instead of plain text in the URL.
With the method that the script is design I am practically going to have to rewrite the whole script in
order to have it do what I want it to do. I am trying to get it to use a MD5 hash that corresponds with
the users session key. This will allow maximum anonymization, becuase if the user leaves the URL in their
History they wont be able to access them anoymore after the session expires, the sessions will be expire in 12
hours or less. Still trying to decide on that part. Either way it is going to be a much more secure way of
handling the URL's. So I am going to pretty much rewrite the entire script. Here we go.
